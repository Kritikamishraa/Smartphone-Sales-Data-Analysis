# Smartphone-Sales-Data-Analysis
Analyzed smartphone sales to identify trends in revenue, brand performance, regional contributions, and average price. Used Pandas for data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation. Employed NumPy for numeric computation. Derived insights that could help optimize marketing and inventory strategies.


# 📊 Smartphone Sales Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing smartphone sales data using Python, focusing on **Pandas** and **NumPy**—two of the most essential libraries for any data analyst. The goal is to derive insights about revenue trends, brand performance, region-wise contributions, and seasonal demand patterns.
